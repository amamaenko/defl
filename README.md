# defl (Deflate [F]oto Library)

Defl is a Python package that is designed to search through the set of 
directories on a local disk, and *intelligently* analyze them for duplicates.

The primary goal is to deduplicate large photolibraries by analyzing various
parameters of the images: EXIFs, brightness, etc.

## No error in the name of the util

"Foto" /ˈfōdō/ - is how "Photo" is pronounced anyways. Perhaps it's not a word
but the short name for the utility just sounds very nice this way.
